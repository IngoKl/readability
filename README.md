# readability
A collection of Python snippets to calculate readability scores.

Currently, this is a (very minimalistic) module for calculating readability scores.

```python
readability = Readability()
readability_scores = readability.score('Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.'))
```
